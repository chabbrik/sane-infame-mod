# Infamy defines tweaks.
#
# BASE_YEARLY_INFAMY_DECAY_RATE: vanilla 5.0 → 6.0
#   +20% passive decay per year. Rewards staying out of wars; countries that
#   fight one justified war and then stop can recover reputation at a reasonable pace.
#
# WAR_GOAL_INFAMY_PEACE_REFUND: vanilla -0.5 → -0.75
#   When a country capitulates or negotiates peace without enforcing a war goal,
#   75% of that goal's staged infamy is refunded (up from 50%). Rewards restraint
#   in peace negotiations — not squeezing every demand from a beaten enemy.
